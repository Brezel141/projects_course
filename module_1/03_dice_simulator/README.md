# Dice Roller

This Python script simulates the rolling of dice. The user can specify the number of dice to roll, and the script will generate random rolls for each die and calculate the total.

## How It Works

The script uses the `random` module to generate random rolls for each die. The user is prompted to enter the number of dice they want to roll. The script then generates that many random rolls, each between 1 and 6 (inclusive), and calculates the total.

The user can continue to roll dice as many times as they want. To exit the program, the user can type 'exit'.

## Usage

Simply run the script, and enter the number of dice you want to roll when prompted. To exit the program, type 'exit'.

## Example

```bash
How many dice would you like to roll? 3
4, 2, 6
Total: 12
How many dice would you like to roll? exit
