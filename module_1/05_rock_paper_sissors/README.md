# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This Python script is a simple implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The script randomly selects a choice for the computer, and the user enters their choice. The script then determines the winner based on the rules of the game.

## How It Works

At the start of the game, the script randomly selects a choice for the computer (rock, paper, or scissors). The user is then prompted to enter their choice (0 for rock, 1 for paper, or 2 for scissors).

The script then compares the user's choice and the computer's choice to determine the winner. The rules are as follows:
- Rock beats scissors
- Scissors beat paper
- Paper beats rock

If both the user and the computer make the same choice, it's a draw.

## Usage

Simply run the script, and enter your choice when prompted. Enjoy the game!

## Example

```bash
What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors.
