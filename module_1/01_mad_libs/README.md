# Interactive Story Generator

This Python script generates a fun, interactive story about bats based on user input.

## How It Works

The script prompts the user to enter various types of words (color, adjective, time, place, food, verb, noun, number). These words are then inserted into a pre-defined story template about bats, creating a unique, personalized story each time the script is run.

## Usage

Simply run the script, and enter the requested words when prompted. At the end, the script will print out your personalized bat story!

## Example

```bash
Enter a color: black
Enter an adjective: scary
Enter a time: midnight
Enter an adjective: friendly
Enter a place: the attic
Enter a food: insects
Enter a food: fruit
Enter a verb: fly
Enter a noun: night sky
Enter a number: 3
