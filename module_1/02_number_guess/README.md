# Number Guessing Game

This Python script is a simple number guessing game. The script generates a random number, and the user has a limited number of attempts to guess it.

## How It Works

At the start of the game, the script generates a random number between 1 and 10. The user is then given 3 attempts to guess the number.

For each attempt, the user is prompted to enter their guess. If the guess is too high, the script informs the user that the number is lower. If the guess is too low, the script informs the user that the number is higher. If the user guesses the number correctly, the script congratulates the user and the game ends.

If the user fails to guess the number within the given number of attempts, the script reveals the correct number and the game ends.

## Usage

Simply run the script, and enter your guesses when prompted. Enjoy the game!

## Example

```bash
Guess the number in the range from 1 to 10.
Guess: 5
The number is lower
Guess: 3
The number is lower
Guess: 2
You guessed it!
